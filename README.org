#+TITLE: My Emacs configuration

As the title subtly suggests, this is my Emacs configuration.
Sometimes it even works, at least for me.  You should make your own,
though.

Very few fancy things here.  No org-based literate config, because
outline and its derivatives provide enough organization for me.  I've
stopped using any Emacs package managers, and fully delegate Emacs
package management to Nix.  I used to use the excellent [[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg/][Borg]], and will
probably use it again whenever I'll want to hack on some packages.
